Leorio, however, returns, unable to run away from a fight. As expected, Leorio is beaten badly and knocked out by Hisoka. Gon, who got separated from Killua, arrives and hits Hisoka in the face with his fishing rod before he could kill Leorio. After the initial hit, Gon nearly gets strangled by Hisoka, but, after concluding that they have passed his ""test"" where he roleplayed as an examiner, Hisoka lets them go. He carries an unconscious Leorio off to the second venue, and it is shown that Hisoka is collaborating with an unknown candidate. Gon leaves by himself and finds Kurapika, who had returned and witnessed the entire scene, and they both head for the site of Phase Two of the exam. Kurapika analyzes Hisoka's behavior, believing that the magician has his own standards of judging whether the person he meets is worthy of fighting against or killing. Gon confesses to Kurapika that he actually feels afraid of his encounter with Hisoka. ",252322,TV-14,tt2108770,9.0,54,2015-10-07 12:39:39

Satotz leads what remains of the candidates to meet the second phase examiners, named Menchi and Buhara. The examiners declare the next phase is to test their cooking skills, much to the candidates' disbelief. The test requires pork, so the candidates are sent to find pigs in the forest. However, the pigs living inside the forest are carnivorous and tear through the candidates. Thanks to Gon, they discover the pigs' weakness and they manage to each get one for their cooking. Upon tasting the candidates' cooking, Buhara gives a pass but Menchi fails all of them. Knowing the candidates will riot, Satotz informs Chairman Netoros of the Hunter Selection Committee to make an appearance. Netoros arrives to correct Menchi's habit of getting biased whenever it's related to cooking. Netoros allows Menchi to stay on as examiner, and she gives the candidates a retest: boil eggs laid by spider eagles on Mt. Split-in-Half. The candidates ride on Netoros' airship to the mountain where they learn they have to jump down a potentially fatal height to get the eggs. Having seen and learnt how Menchi gets her egg, Gon leads some of the other candidates into successfully getting their own. Some candidates are killed while rashly trying to get their eggs while others refuse to take the leap. Out of the 50 candidates who survive to reach Phase Two, 42 candidates now remain.

Gon and Killua explore the airship, and Killua tells Gon that he is actually from a family of assassins. He wished to strike out on his own, which his family has not taken lightly. Neteros arrives and tests both boys' instinct and asks how they felt about the difficulty of the exam. Neteros invites both of them to a game, whoever can grab the ball he is holding before dawn will immediately pass the exam. Gon and Killua find it too hard to pass up, but discovers that with Neteros' skills, they are unable to grab the ball. Eventually Killua realizes that with their skills, they will never be able to take the ball from Neteros for a year, if he keeps it up. Killua retires, but then takes it out on two candidates who harass him, by maiming and killing them. Gon continues trying to grab the ball, and uses a headbutt on Neteros. The old man realizes that Gon will crack his skull if he continues with his headbutt, so he uses his right hand to push Gon away from him. Gon then tells Neteros then he has managed to get him to use his right hand once, which he had not used from the start of the challenge. After his speech, Gon falls asleep from exhaustion.

An experienced rock climber candidate tries to climb down but is eaten by some flying monsters. Later, Kurapika finds that more than half of the candidates have discovered hidden doors to go inside the tower, which Gon finds one as well. However, the catch is that there are many hidden doors, each one can be only used once and only one person can fit through a door, which means they have to split up. When they try out different doors, they realize that they end up in the same room. In the room, Gon's group are given instructions and special wristwatches for five of them to follow the majority, but they cannot proceed without a fifth member. Lippo, one of the Phase 3 examiners tells them this while explaining they have chosen the path of majority rule. They will need to cooperate in order to pass this phase. Tonpa eventually joins in as the fifth member, and the exam proceeds. By following majority rule, the group eventually reaches an arena, where they have to face prisoners hired by Lippo to become combatants. Lippo explains that to pass, all they have to do is to win three rounds. But the prisoners are given reduced sentences by one year for every hour they manage to keep the candidates here. Tonpa volunteers to go first, pitting himself against a combatant named Bendot. Tonpa immediatey gives up, leading to Leorio accusing him of sabotaging candidates, which he admits to do every year. Kurapika stops Leorio, saying that this is part of their plan to make them fight each other and waste time. Gon goes next against Sedokan, a jailed serial bomber.

Seeing that his candle is not susceptible to strong winds, he puts it down and sprints towards Sedokan to blow his candle. The next match is between Kurapika and Majitani, who proposes a death match without weapons and and with the condition that one must die or surrender to finish the match.
